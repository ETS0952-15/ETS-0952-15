# Union() set method
 This method is set operation method that contains all elements from both sets.
 The union of two sets can be found using the `union()` method or the `|` operator.
 # Intersection() set method
 This method is set operation method that that are common to both sets and returns a new set containing the common elements, while the `&` operator performs the same operation.
 # Difference() set method
 This method is set operation method of difference between two sets while the set of elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.
# Symmetric_Difference() set method
 This method is set operation method that are in either set but not in both. 
 The symmetric difference of two sets can be found using the `symmetric_difference()` method or the `^` operator.
# Update() Set method 
 This method is set operation method that adds elements from set_b to set_a, modifying set_a in place.
 It can also take multiple sets or iterables as arguments.
# Symmetric_Difference_Update() set method 
 This method is set operation method that modifies set_a to keep only elements that are in either set_a or set_b, but not in both.
 This is useful when you want to retain only the unique elements between two sets.
 It can also take multiple sets or iterables as arguments.
# The intersection_update() set method 
 This method is set operation method that modifies set_a to keep only elements that are also in set_b.
 This is useful when you want to retain only the common elements between two sets.
 It can also take multiple sets or iterables as arguments.
# Set_is_subset(set_a, set_b) set method
 This method is set operation method that returns True if all elements of set_a are in set_b; otherwise, False.
 # Set_is_superset(set_a, set_b) set method
 This method is set operation method that returns True if all elements of set_b are in set_a; otherwise, False.
 # Set_is_disjoint(set_a, set_b) set method
 This method is set operation method that returns True if set_a and set_b have no elements in common; otherwise, False.
