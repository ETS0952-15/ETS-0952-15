# Dict. get() method
This method is dictionary method that returns the value of the specified key.
If the key does not exist, it returns None or the specified default value.
# Dict. items() method
This method is dictionary method that returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
The view object changes when the dictionary changes.
# Dict. keys() method
This method is dictionary method that returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
# Dict. values() method
This method is dictionary method that returns a view object that displays a list of all the values in the dictionary.
The view object is dynamic and reflects any changes made to the dictionary.
# Dict. update() method
This method is dictionary method that updates the dictionary with the elements from another dictionary or from an iterable of key/value pairs.
If the key already exists, the value is updated; if not, a new key/value pair is added.
This method does not return any value; it modifies the original dictionary in place.
This is useful for merging dictionaries or adding new entries without creating a new dictionary.
# Dict. pop() method
This method is dictionary method that removes the specified key and returns the corresponding value.
If the key is not found, it raises a KeyError unless a default value is provided.
This method is useful for removing items from a dictionary while also retrieving their values.
The popitem() method removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair as a tuple.
